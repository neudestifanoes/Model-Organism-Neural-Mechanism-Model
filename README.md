# Model of Bidirectional Plasticity in the Schaffer Collateral Pathway

This computational model is a visualization of the basic mechanisms of synaptic plasticity that are involved in learning and memory. It bridges the gap from the simple model organisms, such as Aplysia, with the more complex mechanisms of the human hippocampus. Our research question will be: how do Aplysia use serotonin to form implicit memories? The answer, which was discovered by Kandel and others, is through synaptic facilitation, where the neurotransmitter serotonin modulates presynaptic terminals such that there is increased neurotransmitter release (Hawkins et al., 2006). This work established the "molecular logic" of memory: a phase of short-lasting duration involving the phosphorylation of proteins (such as PKA, for example) and a phase of long-lasting duration that requires the expression of genes (such as CREB, for example) to make the changes of permanent structure (Kandel, 2001).

This graph is a model of the human reflection of that type of principle, at work within the pathway of the hippocampal system called the Schaffer collateral pathway (CA3 to CA1 neurons), as we describe in our summary. While the specific circuit is different (glutamatergic vs. serotonergic), the basic idea of "learning as a change in synaptic strength" is a conservation.

The x-axis is Time (s), and the y-axis is Synaptic Weight, which is a proxy of the connection strength between a CA3 and CA1 neuron. The model illustrates the mutual plasticity that is important to human "associative memory and spatial learning":

1.  **Baseline (0-40s):** The blue line is a stable, baseline synaptic weight (1.0).
2.  **LTP Induction (40-45s):** "High-Frequency Stimulation (HFS)" period simulates the "Hebb like "repeated glutamate release" we described in our summary. This intense and associative activity causes a phenomenon called Long-Term Potentiation (LTP), a rapid and sustained increase in the weight of the synaptic connections. This is the main way that memory is stored in the hippocampus, which is analogous to the strengthening of the synapses in Aplysia (Bliss & Lomo, 1973).
3.  **LTD Induction (100-105s):** The "Low-Frequency Stimulation (LFS)" period models the process of Long-Term Depression (LTD) Induction. As our summary states, this "longer low-frequency stimulation" causes a weakening of the synaptic strength, whereby the weight will decrease. This is not "unlearning" but an active and necessary process for "updating and forgetting memory" (Dudek & Bear, 1992).

In conclusion, this model captures the "balance between LTP and LTD" that provides flexibility to the human hippocampus. It illustrates how memory, as synaptic-plasticity, is manifested in the human brain as a much more complex, two-way process for encoding, consolidating and fine-tuning our experiences.
